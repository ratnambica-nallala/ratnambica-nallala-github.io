<h3><u>What is CSS</u></h3>
<h4>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. it is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text. 
HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics</h4>
<h4>CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely 
much harder to navigate.</h4>


<h3>Class Vs ID</h3>
<h4>A class is used to group more than one element, whereas an ID is used to identify a single element.</h4>
<h4>A class selector is therefore used to style multiple HTML elements of the same class, while an ID selector is used to style one HTML element</h4>
<h4>The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet defined in head section</h4>
<br>
<h4>The Strucuture of the Class is defined as below in head section</h4>
<img src="Class_Structure.jpg" alt="Class Structure" width="300" height="300">

<p>In the example above, the Class name is defined as .city and we have defined five HTML style attributes(background-color, color,border, margin and padding) within the class .city </p>
<p>There are three div elements to represent 3 different cities according to the .city style definition</p><br>
<img src="3Div_Elements.jpg" alt="Class Structure" width="300" height="300"> 
<p>Three div elements are defined under body section of html which displays as below</p>
<div class="city">
<h2>Wellington</h2>
<p>London is the capital of New Zealand.</p>
</div> 

<div class="city">
<h2>Auckland</h2>
<p>Financial Capital of New Zealand.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
<h2>Christchurch</h2>
<p>Beautiful Landscape of New Zealand</p>
</div>


<h3>What is ID</h3>

<h4>The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name.
and ID cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.</h4>
<h4>The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML elements.The value of attribute must be unique within the HTML document.</h4>

<h4>Given Example, The ID Attribute uses CSS to style an element with the id name "myHeader". we have defined five HTML style attributes(background-color, color,border, margin and padding under myHeader</h4>
<br>
<h4>The Strucuture of the ID is defined as below in head section</h4>
<img src="ID_Structure.jpg" alt="ID Structure" width="300" height="300">
<p>Use CSS to style an element with the id "myHeader": as Example below</p>
<img src="Ex_ID_Structure.jpg" alt="ID Structure" width="300" height="60">
<h1 id="myHeader">Beautiful Places</h1>
