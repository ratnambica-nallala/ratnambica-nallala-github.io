What is CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. it is a design language that makes a website look more appealing than just plain or uninspiring pieces of text. 
HTML largely determines textual content, CSS determines visual structure, layout, and aesthetics
CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience. Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely 
much harder to navigate.


Class Vs ID
A class is used to group more than one element, whereas an ID is used to identify a single element. 
A class selector is therefore used to style multiple HTML elements of the same class, while an ID selector is used to style one HTML element

The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet defined in head section
<head>
	<style>
		.class-name
			{
			HTML Elements
			}
	</style>
</head>


in the example below, the Class name is defined as .city
and we have defined five HTML elements(background-color, color, border, margin and padding) within the class .city
There are three <div> elements to represent 3 different cities according to the .city style definition

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.city {
  background-color: pink;
  color: green;
  border: 5px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<div class="city">
<h2>Wellington</h2>
<p>London is the capital of New Zealand.</p>
</div> 

<div class="city">
<h2>Auckland</h2>
<p>Financial Capital of New Zealand.</p>
</div>

<div class="city">
<h2>Christchurch</h2>
<p>Beautiful Landscape of New Zealand</p>
</div>

</body>
</html>

what is ID?
The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name.
and ID cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.

in the example below, the ID name is defined as .Header
and we have defined five HTML elements(background-color, color, border, margin and padding) within the class.


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#myHeader {
  background-color: pink;
  color: green;
  padding: 5px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
 padding:20px;

} 
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h2>The id Attribute</h2>
<p>Use CSS to style an element with the id "myHeader":</p>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

</body>
</html>
